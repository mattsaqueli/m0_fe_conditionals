Im not completely comfortable yet, although I do thinK Im getting a better understanding of it the more I practice.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

Same with comparisons, Im starting to slowly get the hang of it but I need a bit more time since the assignments took me a little while to complete.


1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

Same as pervious question.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

I went over my "time limit" by about 30 minutes but I also was playing around with it to get a better understanding.


1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I need more time in each, which I will tackle after completing my tasks for the day, also on the weekends when I have more down time to study.

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

Google, reaching out to instructors, contacting my small groups to see if they have a better method, and by attending study halls.
